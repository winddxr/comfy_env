# runtime_executor/

**Implementation target:** [src/runtime_executor/](../../src/runtime_executor/)

## Responsibility

Manages ComfyUI process lifecycle: launching (in candidate or prod environments), capturing output, enforcing timeouts, PID tracking, and process termination.

## Capabilities

### 1. Candidate Run (Transaction Execution)

```rust
fn run_candidate(
    env_path: &Path,
    comfyui_dir: &Path,
    timeout_seconds: u32,
    log_stdout: &Path,
    log_stderr: &Path,
) -> Result<RunOutcome>
```

1. Resolve Python: `venv_python(env_path)`
2. Build command: `[python, <comfyui_dir>/main.py]`
3. Spawn child process
4. Pipe stdout → `log_stdout` file and mirror it to the parent process stdout in real time
5. Pipe stderr → `log_stderr` file and mirror it to the parent process stderr in real time
6. Wait with timeout:
   - If exits before timeout: return `RunOutcome::Passed` or `RunOutcome::Failed(exit_code)`
   - If timeout expires: kill child, return `RunOutcome::TimedOut`

**Contract**: Used by `tx run` and `update run`. The candidate environment is isolated — this never touches prod env or truth files. `RunOutcome::TimedOut` means the observation window ended and the process was deliberately terminated; command layers decide how that maps into transaction status.

### 2. Prod Run (ComfyUI Launch)

```rust
fn run_prod(
    env_path: &Path,
    comfyui_dir: &Path,
    args: &[String],
    pid_path: &Path,
) -> Result<i32>
```

1. Check stale PID (via `platform::is_process_alive`)
2. Resolve Python: `venv_python(env_path)`
3. Build command: `[python, <comfyui_dir>/main.py] + args`
4. Spawn child process
5. Write child PID to `pid_path`
6. Wait for child exit
7. Remove PID file
8. Return child exit code

**Contract**: Blocks until ComfyUI exits. PID file exists only while process is running. Differs from Bash era (`exec` replaced the process) — Rust spawns a child to enable PID tracking.

### 3. Stop

```rust
fn stop(pid_path: &Path, grace_seconds: u32) -> Result<StopOutcome>
```

1. Read PID from file
2. If file missing: return `StopOutcome::NotRunning`
3. Check liveness via `platform::is_process_alive`
4. If dead: clean up stale PID file, return `StopOutcome::AlreadyStopped`
5. Call `platform::terminate_process(pid, grace_seconds)`
6. Clean up PID file
7. Return `StopOutcome::Terminated`

### 4. RunOutcome

```rust
enum RunOutcome {
    Passed,           // exit code 0
    Failed(i32),      // non-zero exit code
    TimedOut,         // killed after observation timeout
}
```

**Command-layer mapping**:

- `tx run` / `update run` should persist the real `run_exit_code` for audit.
- `TimedOut` should normally map to transaction `status=completed`, not `failed`, because the bounded observation finished successfully even though the process did not exit on its own.

### 5. StopOutcome

```rust
enum StopOutcome {
    Terminated,       // process was killed
    AlreadyStopped,   // stale PID, cleaned up
    NotRunning,       // no PID file
}
```

## Log File Conventions

All logs go to `state/logs/`. Naming patterns:

| Scenario | stdout | stderr |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Candidate run (`tx run`, `update run`) | `state/logs/<txid>.stdout.log` | `state/logs/<txid>.stderr.log` |
| Lock conflict | — | `state/conflicts/<txid>.lock.log` |

Candidate run output is dual-channel by contract: operators see it live in the terminal, and the same bytes are written to `state/logs/` for audit.

Prod run (`gov run`) does NOT write to `state/logs/` — ComfyUI output goes to the terminal (inherited stdout/stderr from the parent process).

## Dependencies

- `platform/` — venv_python, is_process_alive, terminate_process
- `std::process::Command` — process spawning
- `std::time::Duration` — timeout enforcement

## Used By

- `application/tx.rs` — candidate run during `tx run`
- `application/update.rs` — candidate run during `update run`
- `application/runtime.rs` — prod run and stop
