# Comfy Env Architecture Haiku

## Metadata

- Status: Active
- Last Reviewed: 2026-04-17

## 1. System Identity / Goals / Non-Goals / Assumptions

- System Identity: `comfy_env` is a sidecar governance CLI that controls how ComfyUI custom-node dependency changes are observed, promoted, rolled back, and run.
- Goals:
  - Make local dependency state reproducible from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
  - Make runtime prerequisites explicit through `gov init --comfyui-dir --python`.
  - Force plugin dependency changes through an observable candidate transaction before production promotion.
  - Handle ComfyUI core requirements through `install` and `update` flows without bypassing local truth.
  - Allow direct exact-version compatibility pins through shared `dependency-groups.overrides` without waiting for a conflict-resolution flow.
  - Hand off a verified environment through `env export` and `env import` without re-cloning plugins or redefining local truth ownership.
  - Preserve auditable state for transactions, operations, conflicts, and plugin registration.
  - Prefer automatic recovery before leaving local truth in a partially changed state.
- Non-Goals:
  - It does not manage ComfyUI application logic or node business behavior.
  - It does not provide concurrent multi-user coordination or remote orchestration.
  - It does not restore purged plugin source code during `undo`.
  - It does not preserve source-machine `comfyui_dir` as bundle truth or ship VCS admin metadata as part of source handoff.
- Assumptions:
  - `uv`, `git`, and Python are available on the host.
  - `comfy_env` and `ComfyUI` run in sidecar layout, with `paths.comfyui_dir` pointing at the managed ComfyUI root.
  - Local state files are trusted as single-user workstation state, not shared source-of-truth in Git.

## 2. Scope Boundary & Context

- Actors:
  - Local operator running `bin/gov`.
  - ComfyUI runtime launched by `gov run` or exercised indirectly by `gov tx run`.
  - External plugin Git repositories.
- External Dependencies:
  - `uv` for lock/sync/add/remove/freeze.
  - `git` for clone/checkout.
  - Host OS process control for timeout and signals.
  - ComfyUI entrypoint at `main.py`.
- Trust Boundaries:
  - `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `state/*` are local truth inside the sidecar.
  - Plugin repositories and ComfyUI source tree are external inputs.
  - `uv` solver output is trusted only after lock/sync succeeds.
- C4 L1 Summary:
  - `application-core` accepts CLI commands and orchestrates use cases.
  - Peer subsystems own state semantics and safety rules.
  - Infrastructure adapters translate those use cases into `uv`, `git`, filesystem, and process operations.

## 3. Architectural Invariants

1. All production dependency mutations are anchored in local truth files first, then applied to `.venv-prod`.
2. A transaction is the only supported observation unit for plugin dependency impact before promotion.
3. Destructive state changes (`promote`, `remove`, `undo`) must create or use operation backups before finalizing.
4. Lock conflicts must surface as explicit conflict artifacts and a resolvable transaction state, not silent partial success.
5. Core package drift is policy-gated and cannot promote without explicit approval.
6. `state/plugins.json` is registry metadata; dependency-group content in `pyproject.toml` remains authoritative for actual dependency removal.
7. `env export` / `env import` bundles are transport artifacts; after import, local truth remains root `pyproject.toml + uv.lock`, while `paths.comfyui_dir` stays target-local configuration.
8. Bundle source snapshots represent runtime working trees and must exclude VCS admin metadata such as `.git/`.

## 4. Top-Level Decomposition

- Application Core:
  - [Governance CLI Orchestrator](./application-core/spec.md): command dispatch plus surface use cases for bootstrap/install, global override pin management, plugin lifecycle, plugin tx, core update tx, audit/undo, and runtime control.
- Peer Subsystems:
  - [State Ledger](./subsystems/state-ledger/spec.md): durable local records for transactions, operations, plugin registry, and conflict artifacts (I1).
  - [Safety Guards](./subsystems/safety-guards/spec.md): core-impact gate, backup discipline, rollback posture, undo hash guard (I5).
- Infrastructure Adapters:
  - [Dependency Sync](./subsystems/dependency-sync/spec.md): `uv` lock/sync/add/remove/freeze, `pylock.toml` export, bundle compatibility checks, and environment materialization (I2).
  - [Source Integration](./subsystems/source-integration/spec.md): plugin clone/checkout, install-path mapping, and runtime snapshot export/import for `custom_nodes` (I3).
  - [Runtime Executor](./subsystems/runtime-executor/spec.md): candidate/prod Python execution, ComfyUI launch, timeout, PID, logs (I4).

## 7. Data Sovereignty & Integration

- Source of Truth by Domain:
  - Dependency truth: [`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`](./data/spec.md)
  - Plugin registry truth: [`state/plugins.json`](./subsystems/state-ledger/contracts.md)
  - Transaction truth: [`state/transactions/*.json`](./subsystems/state-ledger/contracts.md)
  - Operation backup truth: [`state/ops/<op_id>/`](./subsystems/state-ledger/contracts.md)
  - Runtime liveness hint: `state/comfyui.pid` in [operations/spec.md](./operations/spec.md)
  - Transfer artifact: `env export` bundle (`manifest.json`, `pylock.toml`, `state/plugins.json`, `custom_nodes/*`, audit files)
- Integration Boundaries:
  - `git` only touches plugin source directories.
  - `uv` owns lock calculation and virtualenv synchronization.
  - ComfyUI runtime is an external executable target; `comfy_env` only launches, times out, and stops it.

- Policy Index Links:
  - [Core Impact Gate](./policies/core-impact-gate.md)
  - [Rollback Safety](./policies/rollback-safety.md)

## 9. NFR

- Reliability: failure paths prefer restore + re-sync over partial success; see [nfr/spec.md](./nfr/spec.md).
- Performance: lock/sync and runtime startup are host-bound, so the system optimizes for correctness over latency; see [nfr/spec.md](./nfr/spec.md).
- Security: local-only trust, no secret distribution, limited to shelling out into known tools; see [nfr/spec.md](./nfr/spec.md).
- Observability: transactions, operations, conflict reports, and logs are first-class artifacts; see [operations/spec.md](./operations/spec.md).

## 10. Glossary / ADR Index / Open Questions / Risk Register

- Glossary:
  - Transaction: candidate execution record before promotion.
  - Operation: backup-protected state mutation with optional undo.
  - Promote: applying transaction-derived dependency changes to local truth and `.venv-prod`.
- ADR Index:
  - [ADR-001 Global Pin Management via `dependency-groups.overrides`](./adr/001-global-pin-management.md)
- Open Questions:
  - The codebase is a single shell entrypoint; future extraction into separate scripts may require re-drawing module boundaries from logical to physical modules.
  - Plugin `resolve` still uses interactive stdin while `update resolve` is parameterized; the long-term convergence path is still open.
- Risk Register:
  - No explicit file locking, so overlapping local invocations can race on the same state files.
  - `undo` protects local truth files but intentionally excludes purged source trees.
  - `env import` is an exact-restore flow and will remove bundle-external `custom_nodes/*` directories unless they are restored during rollback.
